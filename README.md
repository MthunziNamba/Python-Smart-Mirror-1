My project is a smart mirror, that does both informational display and voice command recognition. The overarching goal was to blend technology into someone's life as seamlessly as possible, through a mix of subtle design and technological convience. 

There are quite a number of modules relevant to this project, so to install them all:
(make sure to run these commands in administrator command prompt)
Speech Recognition:
	pip install SpeechRecognition
PyAudio:
	python -m pip install pyaudio
OpenCV and Numpy:
	Follow these instructions for Python 3:

dateutils:
	pip install dateutils
Google authentication/apis:
	pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
setuptools:
	pip install setuptools
pyowm:
	pip install pyowm
nltk:
	pip install nltk

To run the program, simply unzip the files, and then run the "smartmirror.py" python file in any python IDE or in terminal.
